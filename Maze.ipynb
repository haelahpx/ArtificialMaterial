    "This code is designed to help an agent find the shortest path through a maze. The robot starts at a specific point and needs to reach the goal, avoiding walls, using the shortest route possible. The algorithm uses A (A-star) search* to solve this problem.\n",
    "1. The Maze:\n",
    "- Imagine a grid, like a board game or a map, with walls (#), an empty path (spaces), a starting point (o), and a goal (x).\n",
    "- The robot starts at o and tries to reach x by moving in different directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonally).\n",
    "2. The agentâ€™s job is to figure out how to move from the starting point to the goal while avoiding walls and taking the shortest possible path.\n",
    "3. The agen can move in different directions: up, down, left, right, and even diagonally. It checks which moves are possible. If the next position is a wall (#), the agent can't move there.\n",
    "4. At any point in the maze, the robot knows where it is by keeping track of its current position (coordinates, like (x, y)).\n",
    "5. A Search Algorithm:*\n",
    "- A (A-star)* is a smart way to find the shortest path in a maze.\n",
    "- Cost: How far the robot has already moved.\n",
    "- Heuristic: A guess of how far the robot is from the goal, like using a ruler to measure the distance between two points.\n",
    "- The robot calculates how far it is from the goal using Euclidean distance"
